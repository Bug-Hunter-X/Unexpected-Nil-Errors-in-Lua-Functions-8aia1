This repository demonstrates a common error in Lua programming related to handling nil values.  The `bug.lua` file shows a function that fails to explicitly handle a nil argument, resulting in an error when the function is called without any arguments. The solution, found in `bugSolution.lua`, addresses this by providing a default return value when the argument is nil, preventing the error. This illustrates the importance of robust nil handling in Lua for creating more resilient and less error-prone code.
